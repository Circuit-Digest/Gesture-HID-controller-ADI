In the world of do-it-yourself (DIY) electronics, the ESP32 has gained immense popularity for its versatility and power. While commonly known for its use in IoT applications, the ESP32 can also be utilized to create various human interface devices (HID), such as a mouse or keyboard. With its built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, coupled with its processing power and GPIO pins, the ESP32 provides an excellent platform for creating your very own customized HID keyboard.
Designing and building your DIY ESP32-based HID Keyboard offers a unique opportunity to dive into the world of embedded systems and create a device to your specific needs. This project allows you to unleash your creativity and explore the possibilities of the ESP32 HID functionality. With the help of ESP32's Bluetooth functionality, you can wirelessly connect your HID mouse to various devices, such as computers, laptops, smartphones, or tablets, making it a versatile and convenient input device. Whether you want to enhance your gaming experience, control multimedia applications, or simply navigate your computer with a custom-made mouse.
Here by adding an adxl345 accelerometer, we can program the microcontroller to simulate keyboard actions by gestures, like left and right clicks, front and back clicks etc. This means you can navigate your computer's interface, control presentations, or interact with applications without physically touching your computer's keyboard.
